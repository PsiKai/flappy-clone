## Flappy Bird Clone
Utilizing the p5.js library to mimic the popular flappy bird mobile game.

### Gameplay
Use the spacebar or mouse click to make the bird fly upwards.  Gravity is constantly pulling the bird down.  Avoid the pipes by positioning the bird in between the openings of the pipes as you fly forward.  Score is accumulated for every frame you're not intersecting with a pipe.  The score is deducted for colliding with the pipes.
